# TJHSST CS
This repository will contain my code and other relevant files pertaining to my CS-related coursework at TJHSST. 

As of now, only my code for the Artificial Intelligence 1 and Web Application Development courses have been made public. Therefore, if you click on another submodule that has remained private, you will see a 404 page.
